# Task A: Segment left ventricle endocardium

## To run on testset:
1. Download the Pretrained_Model_Weights folder. (link: https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ychen506_jh_edu/Et80TpzqJ3NApfD6x9vhgHoB4k8G1pEPLNIxWmp4-YfVUg?e=vVqStb)
2. Open Project1_TaskA_RunTest.ipynb.
2. Set testset path.
3. Set the the pretrained model weights path.
4. Set the number of chamber view you plan to run (set it as 2 or 4).
5. Run the cells in code in order.

# Task B & C: Cardiac 3D Reconstruction

## Introduction

This MATLAB project is designed to take two input ultrasound cardiac images and generate a 3D model of the left ventricle and estimate the stroke volume and ejection fraction.

## Installation

To install this project, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download MATLAB from the MathWorks website.

You will also need to install the following dependencies:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Image Toolbox

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the main.m script.
3. The 3D animation, stroke volume and ejection fraction will be calculated and displayed.
